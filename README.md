# Agile_Final is the summation of the software development life cycles class
# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories”     help with this?
  # Interpreting user needs begins with active listening and asking the right questions to understand not just what users want, but why they want it. Creating user stories is a powerful tool in this process because it shifts the focus from technical implementation to real-world use
  
# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future   development work?
  # My approach to developing programs involves starting with clear, testable goals, and iterating through design, implementation, and testing phases with regular feedback. I value an Agile mindset, especially the Scrum framework, because it encourages short development cycles, constant collaboration, and adaptability. In future projects, I plan to incorporate Agile practices such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and continuous integration. These practices help keep the team aligned, identify blockers early, and ensure the product evolves in response to real-time feedback.
  
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  # Being a good team member means being reliable, communicative, and open to feedback. It also means respecting others’ perspectives, contributing to team goals, and helping teammates when possible. In software development, collaboration is key—no one builds software alone. A good team member not only writes clean, functional code, but also participates in code reviews, helps maintain documentation, and stays engaged during Agile ceremonies like sprint reviews and retrospectives.
